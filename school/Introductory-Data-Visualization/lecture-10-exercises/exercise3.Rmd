```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(jsonlite)
# Create a variable of your API key


# Store the name of your band in a variable


# Creat another variable that replaces your spaces with +'s (hint: gsub)


# Write a query to get the first biography of your band on echonest
# See: http://developer.echonest.com/docs/v4/artist.html#biographies

# Use the fromJSON command to retrieve your data, and store the text of the first biography in a variable


# Run another query to get band images: see: http://developer.echonest.com/docs/v4/artist.html#images
### Warning: you may get an error message if the image is not available -- check online that it exists!

# Use the fromJSON command to retrieve your data, and store the url of the first image in a variable


# Outside of this code section, write the (R)Markdown syntax that:
# - States the name of your band
# - Displays the bio you just retrieved 
# - Shows the image of your band

### Bonus ###
# Make another request, and retrieve/display the band's top songs
# Wrap the above steps in a function that takes a band as a parameter, and returns the desired info
