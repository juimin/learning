# Final-Project-X

Our final project may be viewed here: <a href="https://ericsueckert.shinyapps.io/college_admissions_visualization/"target="_blank">Here</a>


We used [American College Scorecard](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/college-scorecard) as an origin dataset. We summarized useful information, such as SAT and ACT scores, into a new dataset. The reason we used this dataset to **evaluate and analyze** US colleges is because there are hundreds of thousands of high school students that apply to college every year, and every single one of them needs to find colleges that are good academic targets. By using Shiny app and Rstudio, we are able to apply interactive data visualization skills to represent college admissions data in a way that provides insight to such students. <br>
