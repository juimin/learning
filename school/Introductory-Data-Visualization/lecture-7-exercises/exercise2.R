# Install devtools package: allows installations from GitHub
# install.packages('devtools')

# Install "fueleconomy" package from GitHub
# devtools::install_github("hadley/fueleconomy")

# Require/library the fueleconomy package
# library(fueleconomy)

# You should have have access to the vehicles data.frame
# View(vehicles)

# Create a data.frame of vehicles from 1997 (using dplyr)


# Use the `unique` function to verify that there is only 1 value in the `year` column of your new data.frame


# Create a data.frame of 2-Wheel Drive vehicles that get more than 20 miles/gallon in the city (using dplyr)


# Of those vehicles, what is the vehicle ID of the vehicle with the worst hwy mpg? (using dplyr)


# Write a function that takes a year and a make as parameters, and returns 
# The vehicle that gets the most hwy miles/gallon of vehicles of that make in that year (using dplyr)


# What was the most efficient honda model of 1995?
