### Exercise 3 ###

# Run the data() function to see what datasets are available in R


# Load the HairEyeColor dataset by passing it's name to the data function


# You can now reference the HairEyeColor table with the variable name HairEyeColor

# Create a dataframe `students` by converting the HairEyeColor table into a data.frame


# Change the column names of your data.frame to be lowercase


# Using the write.csv function, write your dataframe to a .csv file called "students.csv"


# How many total students were there?


# What were the eye colors represented in the dataset?


# What were the hair colors represented in the dataset?
