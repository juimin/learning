TEAM hw for assignment 7

Submission

Before submitting your assignment, please create a Readme.md file in your repository to answer the following questions (submit the URL of your group's repo as your assignment):


##### 1. Did you receive any help from others (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who.

> I'm pretty sure most of us did our bits individually. Mainly looking at slack to see if there was any useful advice
or asking each other.

##### 2. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?

> Probably like 3-4 combined?

##### 3. On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this challenge?

> The task itself is probably around 4 to 5, but get people to work collaboratively and coordinate each other is the hard part. So a 7 out of 10 for the overall difficulty.

##### 4. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?

> Not really, the only challenge we encountered is to come up with an idea of the chart. There really aren't much to be visualized!
