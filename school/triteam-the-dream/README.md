# DREAM

## Description
This project was focused on providing coordination to a disaster area. Users in the immediate area who had access to a smart device and
had internet access would be able to mark out where aid was needed. Longitude and Latitude could provide pin point positioning and detail what sort of aid was needed. Additionally, relief personel would be able to see which points needed care or were being taken care of which would help in allocating resources.
