# Lazy Devs Recipe

## Description
Final Project for the University of Washington Informatics School's Android Development Course.

This project focused on using the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) in an Android Application to allow users
to find recipes for the ingredients that they currently have available. Users can enter these items and the application
will utilize the API to find recipes that use the majority of the ingredients available.
