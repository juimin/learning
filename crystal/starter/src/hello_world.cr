puts "Hello World"

# Declaring variables is basically the same as anywhere else
# Basically the same style as python
message = "Hello Derek"

# puts is print?
puts message
puts message

p! typeof(message)

# p! is similar to puts as it prints the value to the standard output, but it also prints the expression in code. 
# This makes it a useful tool for inspecting the state of a Crystal program and debugging.

# Observation: This is kinda funky but ok

# Type inference makes reassignment seamless (theoretically)
